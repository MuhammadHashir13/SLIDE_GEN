## üåü Key Features Explained

### AI Content Generation

The system uses Google's Gemini API to generate factual, relevant content for each slide based on your topic. Each slide includes:
- A concise, informative title
- Detailed bullet points or paragraphs
- Proper formatting and organization

### Image System

The application automatically adds relevant images to each slide using a multi-tiered approach:
1. First attempts to find perfect matches via Unsplash API
2. Falls back to topic-based searches if specific searches fail
3. Uses category-based fallback images for guaranteed reliability

The system supports 21+ categories including business, technology, science, art, and more.

### Transitions

Choose from five professional slide transitions:
- **Fade**: Smooth opacity transition between slides
- **Slide**: Slides move from right to left
- **Zoom**: Subtle zoom effect on slide change
- **Flip**: 3D flip animation between slides
- **Cube**: 3D cube rotation effect

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**API Key Problems**
- Ensure your API keys are correctly set in the .env file
- Verify API keys are active and have the necessary permissions

**Image Not Loading**
- Check internet connection
- Verify Unsplash API key is valid
- The system will automatically use fallback images if needed

**Content Generation Issues**
